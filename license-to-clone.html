          The game takes place on a planet named The Dead Desert. Named such

        <p>Dynamic Changes will occur over time, this means that one faction may eventually side with another faction. You can influence these changes or see them unfold the more you play. This can lead to some really interesting changes that even the developers have never experienced.</p>

          Although the game has a vast array of weaponry and armour to choose

          to solve the problems you face.

          Want to recruit a bunch of desert cats to fight for you? It's

          Prefer to solo it and try your hand at engineering? You can bring

        <p>Aaaaand theres blood... Lot's of it... Infact there is so much we had to add a disable blood option right in the settings menu.</p>

        The galaxy is no longer an unreachable void, now it is a playground for
        mankind. Humans have been mining asteroids and colonizing nearby planets
        for the last 500 years. Earth is made up of 3 leading nations: The
        Anglo from the west, The Sino from the east, and The
        Independants. Earth is mostly a peaceful place, with wars only taking
        place between private organizations across the solar system over planet
        claims. SinCorp is the largest company in the solar system, making
        profits from life-extending drugs such as ExtendYoLyf. Through the "battle
        of the balance books", SinCorp became the dominant global force on Earth,
