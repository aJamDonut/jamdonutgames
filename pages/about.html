            Hi there, my names Adam and I am the founder behind Jam Donut. In my career I am a lead developer
            focusing on the Frontend and I often help to lead teams to deliver projects for all sorts of different clients.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I started Jam Donut while just having fun creating hobby games. I started with simple things
            like platformers and such, but quickly moved on to creating complex simulation games.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            After enjoying the process of creating 5 games from scratch, all quite involved and fun I decided
            to embark on a much larger venture, undertaking the creation of my current game License to Clone.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            The game I really wanted to make was a mix of simulation, role-playing and strategy... I knew I wanted
            something that made me think, made me experiment and would keep me interested for hours with something
            new to learn everyday.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            When I set out to create the project I knew it would be large and difficult, I knew that it
            would likely be 4 years before I saw something that resembled the game I wanted.
            In all truthfulness I probably achieved that after 2 years and have been refining and
            adding to the project since.
          </p>

            Hey, I'm Artem. I began my game dev passion with creating small 3D shooter levels in unity.
            I enjoyed creating different gun animations and gun effects.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            While developing these levels I got into video editting and started making
            shorts for myself and my friends... This would become invaluable as
            I am now resposible for the video content we create here.

            I've had a long influence of games shaping my interests, portal, prison architect
            the list goes on.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I enjoy my strategy games with a bit of true history mixed in, enjoying CK3
            and others within the genre. They've inflated my steam playtime but also
            enhanced my historical knowledge.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            Games and technology are my essence. Working on a project that
            channels my passion and creativity while resonating deeply with me
            is a dream come true.
