            Greetings, everyone! I'm the mastermind behind our games. My journey
            began with creating games and animations as a kid, a hobby that
            quickly became a passion.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I've always relished the challenge of tough games. From the
            adrenaline-fueled time trials in DeadRising to the strategic
            scarcity of ammo in Alan Wake, these experiences shaped my gaming
            palate.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            As the indie game scene exploded, I found myself drawn to
            groundbreaking titles like Kerbal Space Program, Ark, and Oxygen Not
            Includedâ€”now legends in the gaming world.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            The release of GameDev Tycoon on Steam Greenlight was a turning
            point for me. Written in JavaScript, its elegant simplicity and
            massive success inspired me. I realized that with my JavaScript
            skills, I could create something extraordinary.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            Driven by this epiphany, I embarked on a quest to master game
            development. I started by crafting free games for everyone to enjoy,
            constantly pushing myself to innovate. My ultimate goal? To create
            the most complex and captivating game possible using JavaScript.

          <p class="card-text">
            Embarking on my game development odyssey, I dove into Unity to craft
            my own FPS game while toggling between ambitions of indie game dev
            and YouTube stardom.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            During this phase, I honed my video-editing prowess through various
            YouTube ventures and creating hilarious videos for friends.
            Surprisingly, these skills have proven invaluable.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            My creative spark is fueled by iconic games like Portal 2, with its
            eerie liminal spaces and intricate puzzles, and Minecraft, which
            unlocked my boundless creativity. Games like RimWorld and Prison
            Architect, which deeply influence our current project, have been my
            long-time companions.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I also thrive on grand strategy games like Europa Universalis IV,
            Crusader Kings III, and Victoria 3. These games have not only
            inflated my Steam playtime but have also enriched my historical
            knowledge.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            Games and technology are my essence. Working on a project that
            channels my passion and creativity while resonating deeply with me
            is a dream come true.
