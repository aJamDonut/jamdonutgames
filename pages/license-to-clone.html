    <h3>ABOUT THE GAME</h3>
    <p>
      You begin by picking the race of your choice which will wake up on a desert
      planet. Pick between; clone, robot, cyborg or a hardened alien race, each
      starts with different stats.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      You start out with gathering resources, talking to NPC's and finding out
      about the different factions present on the planet. You can choose which
      factions to help, join or betray.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      After exploring for some time and helping factions you find blueprints to
      craft custom clones and robots, which require lots of resources and a clone
      vat to craft.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      You explore for more resources, defeating weak foes who posess more valuable
      resources, armours and weapons. Destroying their corpses let's you gather
      much needed Mulch faster.
    </p>
    <img src="img/base.jpg" />
    <p>
      After some time you have enough resources to start your own town, you begin
      by placing a few building and the crafting items you need to make clones,
      using your acquired Mulch
    </p>
  
    <p>
      You start growing some clones and crafting robots to help you progress in
      the games harder areas. After some time you have a couple clone body guards
      and some worker robots in your town.
    </p>
    <p>
      You visit local towns and factions to find out about their bounties, other
      leaders and bosses who's brains hold high value. You track them down and
      kill them to steal their brain and return it for the bounty at a police
      station, or keep it for your own use.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      With your power and resources you begin to grow your town into a city, you
      are essentially another faction on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      You begin exploring the harder areas of the game, aided by your home grown
      clone/robot allies. You are reminded of the factions stopping progress on
      the planet you find yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have a choice, who will you help with your power. There are end game
      "missions" to complete for each of the 3 main factions.
    </p>
